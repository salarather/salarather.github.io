      <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
      <p>
I decided to use Wikipedia pages to analyze how technology has evolved over the past 17 years (since Wikipedia came into existence). I wanted to analyze how technology that has been around for a long time – such as the radio – has changed over time and how more recent and emerging technologies have changed. I am interested in this topic because I use a lot of emerging technologies that are constantly changing and I wanted to see how these technologies compare to old ones as well as try to figure out what point in time changes in technologies were the most frequent – that would help me understand the pivoting point of technological advancements.

      <h3>Page Selection</h3>
      <p>
I grabbed the pages from Wikipedia and tried to create a diverse set. What I mean by a diverse set is that I chose technologies from different fields with a particular focus on telecommunication because I feel like the way we connect has changed drastically over the past couple decades. Other pages chosen range from technologies in medicine, personal computers, memory, entertainment, gaming, artificial intelligence etc. 
      </p>

      <p>
I tried to order the pages by how recent the technologies are – but this is not perfect. At the top you will find more recent and emerging technologies and as you go down the list you will find technologies that have existed for some time now. I decided to do that because I am expecting to see a pattern in emerging technologies vs old/existing technologies and this seemed like the natural order to go through.

      <h3>Key Observations</h3>
      <p>
        There were some interesting finds in the collection of pages. I’ll point out some that really intrigued me:
      </p>

      <ul>
        For the Speech Recognition Wikipedia page, it was very interesting to note that the word ‘neural’ did not start appearing as a top word for the page till 2012 – which is when artificial neural networks started getting popular because of higher computing power. The word ‘deep’ started becoming a top word around 2015, when the term deep learning started becoming popular. The term ‘lstm’ appeared as a top word on the page in 2016 which might be because by 2016 major technology companies including Google, Apple and Microsoft were using LSTMs as fundamental components in their products such as Siri and Amazon Alexa and also because of multiple papers being published which used LSTMs in their neural network architectures.

      </ul>

      <ul>
        For the Wikipedia page on the Internet, one thing that was very interesting was the use of the word cafes becoming very popular in 2003 and 2004 under the section ‘Access’ or ‘Internet Access’. It’s interesting to note that the section on Internet Access was removed as a separate section and placed under Infrastructure in 2014 and has been that way since symbolizing the increased ease of access to the internet in the modern world. Social Impact and Security appeared as separate sections in 2010 and 2014 respectively showcasing the increased sensitivity to the impact of the internet. The word ‘chat’ was pretty popular between 2006 and 2008 and even appeared in the introductory paragraph in those years. 
      </ul>
